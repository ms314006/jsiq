# What is Functional Programming and what are the features of JavaScript that makes it a candidate as a functional language?

**Functional Programming** is a **declarative** programming paradigm or pattern on how we build our applications with **functions** using **expressions** that calculates a value without mutating or changing the arguments that are passed to it.

JavaScript **Array** has `map`, `filter`, `reduce` methods which are the most famous functions in the functional programming world because of their usefulness and because they don't mutate or change the array which makes these functions `pure` and JavaScript supports Closures and Higher Order Functions which are a characteristic of a **Functional Programming Language**.

- The `map` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided callback function on every element in the array.

```javascript
const words = ['Functional', 'Procedural', 'Object-Oriented'];

const wordsLength = words.map((word) => word.length);
```

- The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test in the callback function.

```javascript
const data = [
  { name: 'Mark', isRegistered: true },
  { name: 'Mary', isRegistered: false },
  { name: 'Mae', isRegistered: true },
];

const registeredUsers = data.filter((user) => user.isRegistered);
```

- The `reduce` method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

```javascript
const strs = ['I', ' ', 'am', ' ', 'Iron', ' ', 'Man'];
const result = strs.reduce((acc, currentStr) => acc + currentStr, '');
```
